A simple application written in Go to demonstrate how you can use [werf kube-run](https://werf.io/documentation/v1.2/reference/cli/werf_kube_run.html),
a new [werf](https://github.com/werf/werf) command.

You will need to have a Kubernetes environment, e.g. based on minikube or
an access to any other K8s cluster where this app will run.
